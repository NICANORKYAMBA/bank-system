# Bank System Emulation Project

## Overview

This project is a simulation of a banking system. It's designed to emulate the core functionalities of a bank, providing a platform for users to perform various banking operations virtually. This project is an excellent resource for understanding how banking systems work behind the scenes.

The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend, each with its own dedicated README file for more specific details.

## Structure

- **Frontend**: This directory contains the client-side code of our application. It's responsible for the user interface and user experience. For more details, refer to the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md).

- **Backend**: This directory contains the server-side code of our application. It handles data processing, business logic, and database operations. For more details, refer to the [Backend README](./backend/README.md).

## Features

- **User Management**: The application is responsible for managing users, that is, creating
users, updating users and deleting users
- **Account Management**: Create, update, and delete bank accounts.
